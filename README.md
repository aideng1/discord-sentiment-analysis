# discord-sentiment-analysis
Python scripts to analyse thematic and sentiment distribution in Discord servers

This code was used in the course of analysing data for my master's thesis at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
It contains scripts to analyse the thematic clustering, topic frequency, and sentiment of Discord chat messages which were exported to CSVs.
NB Because Discord chats are short and lack semantic depth, the sentiment analysis script batches the messages into intervals of five minutes.
